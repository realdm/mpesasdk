# Contributing Guidelines

We love contributions! But we'd like you to follow these guidelines to make the contribution process
 easy for everyone involved:

## Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is our main channel to report a bug in the source code or a mistake in the
 documentation, and to request a new feature.

Before submitting your issue, please search the archive. Maybe your question was already answered,
 your bug has already been reported or your feature has already been requested.

Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with
 quickly:

* **Bug report** - if an error is being thrown, please include a stack trace and the steps to
 reproduce the error. If there is no error, please explain why do you consider it a bug.

* **Feature Request** - please make it clear whether you're willing to write the code for it or you
 need someone else to do it.


## Pull Requests

Before making any changes, consider following these steps:

1. Search for an open or closed Pull Request related to your changes.

2. Search the issue tracker for issues related to your changes.

3. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/rosariopfernandes/NotDog/issues/new) to discuss your changes
 with the project owners. If they approve it, send the Pull Request.

### Sending Pull Requests
If your change has been approved, follow this process:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork and configure the
 remotes:

```bash
# Clone your fork into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd <repo-name>
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rosariopfernandes/NotDog
```

2. Make your changes in a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```

3. Commit the changes using a descriptive commit message

```bash
git commit -a
```

  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

4. Push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

5. In GitHub, [send a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a
 clear title and description.

* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required changes;
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this updates your Pull Request):
    ```bash
    # Rebase the branch
    git rebase master -i
    # Update the Pull Request
    git push origin my-fix-branch -f
    ```
That's it! Thank you for you contribution!

### After your Pull Request is merged

You can delete your branch and pull changes from the original
 (upstream) repository:

1. Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub UI or your local shell as follows:

```bash
git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
```

2. Check out the master branch:

```bash
git checkout master -f
```

3. Delete the local branch:

```bash
git branch -D my-fix-branch
```

4. Update your master with the latest upstream version:

```bash
git pull --ff upstream master
```
